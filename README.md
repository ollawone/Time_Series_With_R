`hyndman_koehler.pdf` is a comprehensive peer-reviewed article exploring best practice for choosing between time series forecast models.

`monthly_milk.csv` was downloaded from [Rob Hyndman's Time Series Data Library](https://datamarket.com/data/set/22ox/monthly-milk-production-pounds-per-cow-jan-62-dec-75#!ds=22ox&display=line) and was originally featured in Cryer (1986) _Time series analysis_, Duxbury Press: Belmont.

`daily_milk.csv` is entirely fake data created by Coding Club, generated using `fake_time_data.R`.

`co2_loa.csv` was downloaded from [Rob Hyndman's Time Series Data Library](https://datamarket.com/data/set/22qs/monthly-measurements-of-carbon-dioxide-above-mauna-loa-hawaii-jan-1959-dec-1990-units-parts-per-million-ppm-missing-values-have-been-filled-in-by-linear-interpolation-the-data-were-collected-by-scripps-institute-of-oceanography-la-jolla-california#!ds=22qs&display=line) and was originally hosted by [Oak Ridge National Laboratory](https://daac.ornl.gov/get_data/).

`time_series_script.R` contains all the code in the tutorial and can be used as a quick reference.

'time_series_scriptco2loa.R' contains the code to forecast using the CO2 Concentration data.
